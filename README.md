# HTDP/image.js

A JavaScript port of the Racket Image library used in How To Design Programs.

Special thanks to [Joe Gibbs Politz](https://twitter.com/joepolitz) for all his work on the Pyret language, including translating this library into a JavaScript module for Pyret, and to all who have worked on the code for this library before it was used in Pyret. All I'm really doing is repackaging their work for a different context.
