Special thanks to [Joe Gibbs Politz](https://twitter.com/joepolitz) for all his work on the Pyret language, including translating this library into a JavaScript module for Pyret, the developers of [Whalesong](https://www.hashcollision.org/whalesong/) who originally translated it (or at least parts of it, I'm not 100% sure) into JavaScript, and to all others who have worked on the code for this library. All I'm really doing is updating their work to use modern JavaScript syntax and idioms.
